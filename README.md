# Public API Requests

[View the demo](http://alexhippo.github.io/public-api-request).

This project demonstrates API integration to a Javascript frontend through an employee directory for a fictional company called "Awesome Startup". The API we were required to integrate with for this project was the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/). This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript).

## Structure, style and CSS

 - background colour to `rgb(74, 78, 105)`
